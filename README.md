## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables/coefficients ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided a random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. While, spoiler_angle and vehicle weight provided a non-random amount of variance. 
 
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is not considered to be zero, because the p-value is less than 0.05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar protoypes effectively predicts the correct mpg values because our r-squared value was 0.71, which is about 70%.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The variance for Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the design specification. However, Lot 3 doesn not meet the specification because it exceed the manufacturing specifications.
